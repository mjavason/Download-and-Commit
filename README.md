# Download and Commit

This repository demonstrates an automated workflow using GitHub Actions to download a file from the internet and commit it to the repository.

## How it works

- On every push to the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
- The workflow downloads a file (in this case, a PSP game ZIP file) from a specified URL using `curl`.
- The downloaded file is saved as `game.zip` in the repository.
- The workflow then commits and pushes the new file to the repository using the GitHub Actions bot.

## Workflow file

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/download.yml`.

### Example steps:

1. **Checkout the repository**
2. **Download the file**
3. **Commit and push the file**

You can modify the workflow to download different files or trigger on different events as needed.
